The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the Math.random() method. 
The user is prompted to guess the number, and their guess is compared to the random number using a while loop. 
If the guess is too low or too high, the user is prompted to guess again. 
If the guess is correct, the number of guesses is displayed along with a congratulations message.
